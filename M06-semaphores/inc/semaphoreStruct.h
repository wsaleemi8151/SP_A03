 * Why does this "#ifndef" have an "#else" clause?!?!?
 *
 * What we are doing in the lines below is effectively declaring
 * global variables (acquire_opertion, release_operation and init_values)
 * and in order to avoid any compiler errors about redefinition or
 * redeclaration of reinitialization we can only declare these
 * variables once.  So the "#ifndef" portion of this include file
 * actually declares and initializes them.  So when the first of 
 * the source files is compiled - it will actually execute this
 * "#ifndef" portion.  And when it does, as you know it declares
 * a compiler variable called "__SEMAPHORE_STRUCT_H__" which will
 * prevent any other source modules from doing this ...
 *
 * !!BUT!! we need the second (and any other) source files to
 * **know** about the existence of the acquire_opertion, release_operation 
 * and init_values variables - we just don't want those other source files
 * to redeclare or reinitialize them ... so how do we handle this?
 *    --> this is the purpose of the "#else" clause below
 * =========================================================================== */
